<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>This XMPP extension protocol specifies end-to-end encryption for
  data with the help of OpenPGP.</p>
  <p>Furthermore XMPP provides the mechanisms to solve a lot of issues
  that come with modern day OpenPGP usage. PEP provides a standardizes
  way to discovery OpenPGP public keys of other entities while, unlike
  the OpenPGP keyserver, establishing a strong relation between the
  key and the user, and Private XML Storage allows for easy OpenPGP
  key synchronization accross devices (of the same XMPP
  entity). OpenPGP in return allows for end-to-end encrypted data to
  be exchanged between one, two or even multiple entities.</p>
  <p>Unlike to similar XEPs, e.g. OMEMO, this XEP <em>does not</em>
  provide Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), but as advantage, allows
  users to read their archived converstaions, or, in gernal, their
  encrypted data, later on (as long as they still posses the according
  secret key). Perfect Forward Secrecy and being able to decrypt
  archived messages are mutually exclusive, i.e. one can not have
  both. We therefore consider this XEP complementary to similar ones
  which also provide end-to-end encryption but with a different
  feature set.</p>
  <p>The method defined herin can be used to implement end-to-end
  encrypted Multi-User Chats (&xep0045;).</p>

  <section2 topic='Discovering Support' anchor='disco'>
	<p>If an entity supports OpenPGP for XMPP as specified herin, it

	'urn:xmpp:openpgp:0' in response to a &xep0030; information
	request.</p>
  <example caption="Service Discovery information request"><![CDATA[

  <section2 topic='Announcing the public key via PEP' anchor='annoucing-pubkey'>
	<p>In order to annouce the public key, the client needs to store
	it in a &xep0163; node. The public key data, as specified in
	&rfc4880;, is stored within a &lt;pubkey/&gt; element which is a
	child element of the &lt;pubkeys/&gt; qualified by the
	'urn:xmpp:openpgp:0' namespace. Note that OpenPGP's ASCII armor is
	not used, instead the XMPP client MUST encode the public key using
	Base64. Client SHOULD only try to store the public key if the
	Personal Eventing Protocol service supports persistent-items, thus
	it SHOULD check if the service reports the
	'http://jabber.org/protocol/pubsub#persistent-items' feature.</p>
	<example caption='Saving the public key in the Personal Eventing Protocol node.'><![CDATA[
<iq from='juliet@example.org/balcony' type='set' id='1'>

         </item>
      </publish>
    </pubsub>
</iq>]]></example>
  <p>In order to discover the public key of an XMPP entity, clients
  send a PubSub &IQ; request to the entity's bare JID of which it
  wants to know the public key.</p>
  <example caption='Requesting a OpenPGP public key from a XMPP entity.'><![CDATA[
<iq from='romeo@example.org/orchard' to='juliet@example.org' type='get' id='2'>

      </item>
    </publish>
  </pubsub>
</iq>]]></example>
  <p>Note that the result may contain multiple pubkeys elements. Only
  the public keys found in the most recent MUST be used. Requestors
  may want to limit the results to the most recent item using the
  'max_items' attribute set to '1'. (Note: RSM would be an alternative
  but XEP-60 says it is not yet mandatory).</p>
  <p>Some XMPP services may not provide the Personal Eventing Protocol feature required to
  provide the mechanism described here. If so, they will return an
  &IQ; error of type service-unavailable.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Encrypted and signed data' anchor='signcrypt'>
	<p>The &openpgp; extension element qualified by the
	'urn:xmpp:openpgp:0' namespace is used in order to exchange
	encrypted and signed data.</p>
	<example caption='The &openpgp; extension within a message.'><![CDATA[
<message to='user@example.org'>
  <openpgp xmlns='urn:xmpp:openpgp:0'>
    <!-- BASE64_OPENPGP_MESSAGE -->
    WdC81xuET8kAK...
  </openpgp>
</message>]]></example>
	<p>The text content of the &openpgp; element (BASE64_OPENPGP_MESSAGE)
	is a Base64 encoded OpenPGP message which contains
	an encrypted and signed UTF-8 encoded string. Note
	that OpenPGP's ASCII armor is not used, instead the XMPP client
	MUST encode the raw OpenPGP message using Base64. This string
	represents a &signcrypt; extension element. It SHOULD also be
	encrypted to self. Encryption is REQUIRED and signing the data is
	RECOMMENDED.</p>
	<example caption='The &signcrypt; extension element.'><![CDATA[
<signcrypt xmlns='urn:xmpp:openpgp:0'
           to='juliet@example.org'
           timestamp='2014-07-10T17:06:00+02:00'>
  <body xmlns='jabber:client'>
    This is a secret message.
  </body>
</signcrypt>]]></example>
	<p>The &signcrypt; element MUST posses at least one 'to' and
	exactly one 'timestamp' attribute. The 'to' element(s) MUST
	contain the intended recipient's XMPP address of the signed and
	encrypted data to prevent Surreptitious Forward Attacks. The XMPP
	address found in the 'to' attribute SHOULD be without Resourcepart
	(i.e. a bare JID). The 'timestamp' attribute contains the
	timestamp when the &signcrypt; element was signed and encrypted in
	the DateTime format as specified in &xep0082; ¬ß 3.2. Recipients
	are RECOMMENDED to verify the values of these two elements for
	plausability or to display them to a user for verification.</p>
	<p>Child elements of signcryt can be any extension element. The
	example uses the body element as defined in &rfc6121; ¬ß 5.2.3. Note
	that this example uses the 'jabber:client' namespace, but beware
	that the same 'body' element is also defined in the
	'jabber:server' namespace.</p>
	<p>Recipients MUST verify that the signature corresponds to the
	sending XMPP address's key. Thus the recipient may has to
	retrieve the key from the Personal Eventing Protocol node as described above.</p>

<section1 topic='Rationale' anchor='rationale'>
  <p>This specificaiton leaves it open if the used OpenPGP key should
  be a primary key or a subkey. It's even possible to announce
  multiple public keys in the Personal Eventing Protocol
  node. Implementations MUST be prepared to find multiple public
  keys. The authors however believe that for ease of use only one
  OpenPGP key specially crafted for the XMPP uses case should be
  created.</p>
  <p>The &openpgp; and &signcrypt; elements are container for
  arbitrary signed and encrypted data and can thus act as building
  block for encrypting data for Message, IQ and Presence stanzas.</p>
  <p>Note that signed OpenPGP messages already contains a timestamp as per
  the OpenPGP specification. The &signcrypt; element nevertheless
  contains a mandatory 'timestamp' attribute because not every OpenPGP
  API may provide access to the embedded OpenPGP timestamp.</p>
  <section2 topic='Addressing the issues and problems of XEP-0027' anchor='solving-xep0027-issues'>
	<p>This specification addresses all relevant issues of
	XEP-0027. It prevents reply attacks my including the recipient(s)
	and a timestamp in the &signcrypt; element. It allows for both,
	signing and encrypting of the &signcrypt; element. On the other
	hand, the scope of the specification was intentionally limited to
	OpenPGP only.</p>
	<p>Features like signed presences, which is provided by XEP-0027,
	may be added later on as add-on XEP to this.</p>
  </section2>
  <section2 topic='Possible Alternative: Synchronizing the secret key via Private XML Storage' anchor='synchro-private-xml'>
	<p>To allow new XMPP clients to easily retrieve (and eventually
	update) the secret key, &xep0049; is used as synchronization
	mechanism. The secret key MUST be a OpenPGP symmetrically encrypted
	message with a backup code.</p>
	<p>TODO describe format as per
	https://github.com/open-keychain/open-keychain/wiki/Backups)</p>
	<p>In order to set a new secret key, clients store the encrypted

<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>
  <p>The scope of this XEP is intentionally limited, so that the
  specification just defines way for XMPP entities to discover,
  announce and synchronize OpenPGP keys, and how to exchange signed
  and encrypted data between two or more parties. Everything else is
  outside its scope. For example, how "secure' the key material on the
  endpoints is protected, is up to the implementation.</p>
  <p>And while this XEP specifies a mechanism how to discover and
  retrieve a public key, it does not define how the trust relation to
  this key should be established. Even if key discovery and retrieval
  over XMPP provides a stronger coupling between the possessing entity
  (the XMPP address) and the key, as compared to the OpenPGP keyservers,
  how a XMPP server authenticates a remote server is a server policy,
  which does vary from server to server. Implementation MUST provide a
  way for the user to establish and assign trust to a public key. For
  example by using a QR code shown on the other user's device's
  screen.</p>
