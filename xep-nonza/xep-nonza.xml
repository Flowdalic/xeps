<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>The usage of non-Stanza top-level XMPP stream elements is steadily increasing in the last years. Starting with &xep0198;, which is one of the earliest XEPs which specified and used additional non-Stanza elements, the XMPP community sees an increasing usage of those elements in submitted specifications. Unlike Stanzas which are specified in &quot;&rfc6120; ยง 8. XML Stanzas&quot;, there is no term and definition provided for them .</p>
  <p>This leads to the unfortunate situation where some submitted XEPs errornous refer to non-Stanza top level stream elements as "Stanzas". Thus causing confusion, and opening the door to possible interoperability breakage and security vulnerabilities.</p>
  <p>This XEP tries to fix this by providing a term and a definition for those elements.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Nonza Definition' anchor='nonza'>
  <p><strong>Nonza:</strong> A Nonza is every top level XMPP stream element which is not a Stanza.</p>
  <p>The term Nonza consists of the beginning and ending letters of its definitions and thus makes it easy to recall that definition: <strong>No</strong>t a Sta<strong>nza</strong>.</p>

<section1 topic='Use Cases' anchor='usecases'>
  <p>Nonzas are commonly used when it's not neccessary to route the exchanged information behind the endpoints of an XMPP stream. For example, one use case is to control the Stream like it is done in <cite>XEP-0198: Stream Management</cite>.</p>
</section1>
<section1 topic='Business Rules' anchor='rules'>
  <p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Nonzas MUST NOT be routed, i.e. the are only exchanged between the two endpoints of an XMPP stream.</li>
	  <li>Nonzas MUST NOT have a &apos;from&apos; or &apos;to&apos; attribute.</li>
	</ul>
