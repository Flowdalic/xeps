<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>
  <p>The usage of non-Stanza top level stream elements is steadily increasing in the last years. Starting with XEP-198: Stream Management, which is the first XEP which specified and used additional non-stanza top level stream elements, the XMPP community sees an increasing usage of those elements in submitted specifications. Unlike Stanzas which are specified in &quot;&rfc6120; ยง 8. XML Stanzas&quot;, there is no term and definition provided for them .</p>
  <p>This leads to the situation where some submitted XEPs errornous refer to non-Stanza top level stream elements as "Stanzas". Thus causing confusion, and opening the door to possible interoperability breakage and security vulnerabilities.</p>
  <p>This XEP tries to fix this by providing a term and a definition for those top level elements.</p>

<section1 topic='Nonza definition' anchor='nonza'>
  <p><strong>Nonza:</strong> A Nonza is every top level stream element which is not a Stanza.</p>
  <p>The term Nonza makes it easy to recall it's definition: Not a Stanza. See the following nonza examples:</p>
  <example caption='The Stream Management (XEP-198) &quot;enable&quot; nonza'><![CDATA[
<enable xmlns='urn:xmpp:sm:3'/>]]></example>
  <example caption='The CSI (XEP-352) &quot;active&quot; nonza'><![CDATA[
<active xmlns='urn:xmpp:csi:0'/>]]></example>
