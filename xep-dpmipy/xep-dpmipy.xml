<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>

  <p>In order to avoid unecessary server to client pings, the server needs to be aware of the
  default connection idle-interval after which a client will ping the server. This extensin protocol
  defines a mechanism allowing clients to announce the maximum idle interval, after which they will
  issue a server ping to check for connection liveness.</p>

  <p>Without the mechanism described herin, XMPP client to server connections could be subject to
  unnecessary pings between the server and client. Those are especially problematic on mobile
  connection, where every byte of unnecessarily transfered data may required the baseband module of
  the mobile device to power up, causing unwanted battery drain.</p>

  <p>Assume for example that the server is configured to ping the client after an idle period of 10
  minutes, however, the client being connected to a mobile network is using a optimized value for
  the mobile case of 30 minutes. Since the client's inverval is larger than the server's, every 10
  minutes a ping will be send over the, otherwise idle, connection. If the server wold have been
  aware of the client's setting, it could adapt to it. That is, the server would only send a ping to
  the client no client-initiated connection avitivyt could be observed after the clients maximum
  connection-idle interval has been passed.</p>

  
  <p>TODO/WIP TEXT: Defines a mechanism allowing the client to tell the server that the client will
  never keep the connection idle longer then a certain period of time. This avoid the patholgical
  case where pings from send by the server to check if the connection is still alive wakes a
  sleeping client up. Also compare to &xep0304; and explain what it is not sufficient.</p>

    <p>If an entity supports this,
    i.e., what is specified herein, it MUST advertise that fact by announcing a &xep0030; feature of
    'urn:xmpp:dpipu:0'. It thus includes this feature in response to a service discovery
    request.</p>
