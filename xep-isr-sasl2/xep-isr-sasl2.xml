<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>

  <p>This XEP specifies an instant stream resumption mechanism based
  on &xep0198;, allowing XMPP entities to instantaneously resume an
  XMPP stream. This can be seen as the complementary part to &xep0305;
  allowing for fast XMPP session (re-)establishment.</p>

  <p>Compared to the existing stream resumption mechanism of <link
  url='http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0198.html#resumption'><cite>XEP-0198</cite>
  § 5</link>, the approach defined herein reduces the round trips
  required to resume a stream to exactly <em>one</em>. This is
  achieved by using just a secure short-lived key to resume the
  stream.</p>

<section1 topic='Stream Feature'>

  <p>XMPP entities providing Instant Stream Resumption MUST announce
  that functionality as stream feature, but only if an instant stream
  resumption is possible at this stage. The ISR stream future consists
  of an &lt;isr/&gt; element qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:isr:0'
  namespace. And since ISR requires TLS, this means that the
  &lt;isr/&gt; stream feature only appears on TLS secured
  connections.</p>

  <p>The ISR stream feature element MUST contain a &lt;mechanisms/&gt;
  element as defined in &rfc6120;. This element contains the SASL
  mechanism which are available to be used for instant stream
  resumption.</p>

  <example caption='Server announces the Instant Stream Resumption Stream Feature'><![CDATA[
<stream:stream

      <mechanism>HT-SHA-256-ENDP</mechanism>
    </mechaisms>
  </isr>
</stream:features>
]]></example>

  <p>Every ISR enabled entity MUST support the HT-SHA-256-ENDP
  mechanism, support for HT-SHA-256-UNIQ is RECOMMENDED. The family
  of SASL <cite>HT-*</cite> mechanisms as specified in &sasl-ht;.</p>

</section1>

<section1 topic='Obtaining a Instant Stream Resumption Key' anchor='obtain'>

  <p>In order to obtain an ISR key, the requesting entity must add an
  'isr-enable' element qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:isr:0' namespace to the
  &lt;enable/&gt; element as defined in &xep0198; when attempting to
  enable Stream Management. This &lt;isr-enable/&gt; element MUST contain a
  'mechanism' attribute containing the name of the SASL mechanism the
  requesting entity will use when performing ISR with the returned
  key. The entities involved in ISR MUST only use or allow this
  mechanism when performing ISR with the according key. This
  effectively pins the SASL mechanism <note>Pinning the SASL mechanism
  is believed to increase the security</note>.</p>

  <example caption='An &lt;enable/&gt; Nonza with the ISR &apos;mechanism&apos; element'><![CDATA[
<enable
  xmlns='urn:xmpp:sm:3'
  xmlns:isr='urn:xmpp:isr:0'>
  <isr-enable xmlns='urn:xmpp:isr:0' mechanism='HT-SHA-256-ENDP'/>
</enable>
]]></example>

  <p>Next, the &lt;enabled/&gt; Nonza (see &xep0360;) which is send as
  positive reply upon a request to enable Stream Management, MUST
  contain an 'isr-enabled' element qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:isr:0'
  namespace containing a ISR key as value of its 'key' attribute. The
  key MUST be newly generated by a cryptographically secure random
  number generator and MUST contain at lest 128 bit of entropy. The
  &lt;isr-enabled/&gt; element can optionally also contain a
  'location' attribute qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:isr:0' namespace
  which specifies the preferred IP address or hostname, and a TCP port
  number of the host which should be used for instant stream
  resumption.</p>

  <example caption='An &lt;enabled/&gt; Nonza with a ISR key'><![CDATA[
<enabled
  xmlns='urn:xmpp:sm:3'
  xmlns:isr='urn:xmpp:isr:0'>
  <isr-enabled xmlns='urn:xmpp:isr:0' key='a0b9162d-0981-4c7d-9174-1f55aedd1f52'/>
</enabled>]]></example>

  <example caption='An &lt;enabled/&gt; Nonza with a ISR key and location'><![CDATA[
<enabled
  xmlns='urn:xmpp:sm:3'
  xmlns:isr='urn:xmpp:isr:0'>
  isr:key='a0b9162d-0981-4c7d-9174-1f55aedd1f52'
  isr:location='isr.example.org:5222'/>
</enabled>]]></example>

  <p>The &lt;enabled/&gt; Nonza containing an ISR key MUST only be
  sent over TLS secured connections.</p>

</section1>

<section1 topic='Instant Stream Resumption' anchor='isr'>

  <p>In order to instantaneously resume an XMPP stream the initiating
  entity, which is either an XMPP client or server, must posses a
  valid ISR key. After it has obtained the ISR key, using the process
  described in the previous section, it first determines the host for
  resumption, and after that, tries to perform the instant stream
  resumption.</p>

  <section2 topic='Determing the Host for Resumption' anchor='host'>

  <p>The lookup mechanism order to determine host candidates for ISR
  resumption is as follows:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>The host provided in the optional 'location' attribute
    qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:isr:0' namespace found in the
    &lt;enabled/&gt; element of <cite>XEP-0198</cite> (the
    "isr:location").
    </li>
    <li>The hosts determined by means of &xep0368;.</li>
    <li>The host announced in the 'location' attribute of the
    &lt;enabled/&gt; Nonza defined in <cite>XEP-0198</cite>.</li>
    <li>Standard host lookup mechanisms.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>The host candidates retrieved by those mechanisms SHOULD be
  tried by the initiating entity in this order.</p>

  <p>Note that the hosts announced by the 'location' attribute
  qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:isr:0' namespace MUST be connected to
  using TLS from the beginning, i.e. &lt;starttls/&gt; MUST NOT be
  used, instead the TLS handshake is performed right after
  establishing the connection.</p>

  <p>This order prefers hosts which allow connections where TLS is
  enabled from the beginning. This is desirable to reduce the
  required round trips by skipping the &lt;starttls/&gt; step.</p>

  </section2>

  <section2 topic='Performing Instant Stream Resumption' anchor='resume'>

  <p>After the remote host on which the instant stream resumption
  should be performed was determined, the initiating entity connects
  to the host, and establishes TLS by either</p>

  <ol>
    <li>establishing a TLS session right away, or</li>
    <li>performing STARTTLS (&rfc6120; § 5).</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Now the initiating entity sends an XMPP &lt;stream&gt; open
  element followed by a &lt;authenticate/&gt; Nonza as specified in
  the &xep0388;. The initiating entity must also provide a
  &lt;inst-resume/&gt; element qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:isr:0'
  namespace, which must contain a &lt;resume/&gt; element as defined
  in &xep0198;.</p>

  <p>If the 'without-isr-token' attribute is set to true, then the
  SASL mechanisms are performed as when traditionally authenticating
  the XMPP session. If the value of the attribute is 'false', which is
  the default value for this attribute, then the "password" given to
  the SASL mechanism is the ISR key. Note that this implies that only
  SASL mechanisms which take a password/token can be used this
  way.</p>

  <p>All ISR implementations MUST support the
  HT-SHA-256-ENDP mechanism.</p>

  <example caption='Initiating entity requests instant stream resumption via the Extensible SASL Profile (XEP-0388)'><![CDATA[
<?xml version='1.0'?>
<stream:stream
    from='juliet@im.example.com'
    to='im.example.com'
    version='1.0'
    xml:lang='en'
    xmlns='jabber:client'
    xmlns:stream='http://etherx.jabber.org/streams'>

<authenticate xmlns='urn:xmpp:sasl:0' mechanism='HT-SHA-256-ENDP'>
  <initial-response></initial-response>
  <inst-resume xmlns='urn:xmpp:isr:0' without-isr-token='false'/>
    <resume xmlns='urn:xmpp:sm:3'
            h='some-sequence-number'
            previd='some-long-sm-id'/>
  </inst-resume>
</authenticate>
]]></example>

    <p>Note that the initiating entity SHOULD pipeline the instant
  stream resumption request together with then initial
  &lt;stream&gt; open element. The initiating entity is able to do
  so since it already knows that the service supports ISR because it
  announced an ISR key.</p>

  <p>Servers MUST destroy the ISR key of a stream after an instant
  stream resumption was attempted for that stream with an invalid ISR
  key. Server implementations MUST implement the ISR key comparision in
  linear runtime.</p>

  <section3 topic='Successful Stream Resumption' anchor='isr-success'>

  <example caption='Successful Instant Stream Resumption'><![CDATA[
<success xmlns='urn:xmpp:sasl:0'>z
  <success-data></success-data>
  <inst-resumed xmlns='urn:xmpp:isr:o'
                key='006b1a29-c549-41c7-a12c-2a931822f8c0'>
    <resumed xmlns='urn:xmpp:sm:3' h='354' previd='123'/>
  </inst-resumed>
</success>
]]></example>

  <p>On success the server replies with a &lt;success/&gt; nonza as
  specified in the &xep0388;, which must include a
  &lt;inst-resumed/&gt; element qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:isr:0'
  namespace. This element MUST contain a <em>new</em> ISR Key found in
  the 'key' attribute. It also MUST include a &lt;resumed/&gt; as
  specified in &xep0198; containing the sequence number of the last by
  Stream Management handled stanza in the 'h' attribute and the
  'previd' attribute.</p>

  <p>In case of an successful Instant Stream Resumption authenticated
  by an ISR key, the server MUST immediately destroy the ISR key after
  authentication, i.e., it MUST no longer be possible to perform an
  ISR using that ISR key and Stream Management ID (SM-ID, see
  &xep0198;) tuple.</p>

  <p>After the &lt;inst-resumed/&gt; was received and has been
  verified both entities MUST consider the resumed stream to be
  re-established. This includes all previously negotiated stream
  features like &xep0138;. It does however not include the specific
  state of the features: For example in case of Stream Compression,
  the dictionary used by the compression mechanism of the resumed
  stream MUST NOT be considered to be restored after instant stream
  resumption.</p>

  <p class='box'>Note that this behavior is different from &xep0198;
  stream resumption, where "outer stream" features like compression
  are not restored. Since such a behavior would be counterproductive
  towards the goal of this XEP, it specifies that the negotiation
  state of such "outer stream" features is also restored (besides the
  features which where already negotiated at ISR-time, i.e. TLS).</p>

  </section3>

    <section3 topic='Successful Authentication but failed Stream Resumption' anchor='isr-auth-success-resumption-failed'>

    <p>If the server was able to authenticate the initiating entity
    but is unable to resume the stream instantly it MUST reply with a
    &lt;success/&gt; Nonza as defined in the &xep0388; containing
    a &lt;inst-resume-failed/&gt; element qualified by the
    'urn:xmpp:isr:0' namespace. This
    &lt;inst-resume-failed/&gt; MUST contain a &lt;failed/&gt;
    element as defined in &xep0198;.</p>

    <example caption='Server indicates instant stream resumption failure'><![CDATA[
<success xmlns='urn:xmpp:sasl:0'>
  <inst-resume-failed xmlns='urn:xmpp:isr:0'>
    <failed xmlns='urn:xmpp:sm:3'
            h='another-sequence-number'>
      <item-not-found xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-stanzas'/>
    </failed>
  </inst-resume-failed>
</sucess>
]]></example>

    <p>Instant stream resumption errors SHOULD be considered
    recoverable, the initiating entity MAY continue with normal
    session establishment; however, misuse of stream management MAY
    result in termination of the stream. Since the initiating entity is
    authenticated, it could continue with resource binding by using
    &rfc6120; § 7. or &xep0386;.</p>

  </section3>

  <section3 topic='Multi SASL Mechanism ISR' anchor='multi-sasl-mech-isr'>

    <p>As specified in the &xep0388; § 2.6.4, a single SASL
    mechanism may not be sufficient for authentication. In this case,
    the remote entity sends a &lt;continue/&gt; element as defined in
    &xep0388; to request the local entity to perform another
    SASL mechanism. Performing instant stream resumption using
    multiple SASL mechanisms MUST only be done if the
    'without-isr-token' attribute is set to 'true'.</p>

    <example caption='Server requires Multi SASL Mechanism ISR'><![CDATA[
<continue xmlns='urn:xmpp:sasl:0'>
  <additional-data>

    <mechanism>TOTP-EXAMPLE</mechanism>
  <mechanisms>
</continue>
]]></example>

  </section3>

    <section3 topic='Failed ISR Authentication' anchor='isr-auth-failed'>

    <p>If the server is unable to authenticate the initiating entity
    it replies with a &lt;failure/&gt; Nonza as defined in
    &xep0388;. The server MUST delete any state of the stream which
    was attempted to resume in case the SM-ID was correct but the
    authentication failed.<note>This is to prevent brute force
    attacks.</note></p>

    <example caption='Server indicates instant stream resumption failure'><![CDATA[
<failure xmlns='urn:xmpp:sasl:0'>
    <not-authorized xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl'/>
</failure>
]]></example>

    <p>After the ISR authentication has failed, the initiating entity
    could continue with normal authentication (&xep0388;,
    …).</p>

<section1 topic='Security Considerations' anchor='security'>

  <p>Putting ISR data in <cite>TLS 1.3</cite> 0-RTT early data is
  forbidden. (TODO: Shall we weaken this requirement to allow early
  data?. It would be technically possible if the sender does not add
  additional data, for example Stanzas, after the ISR/XEP-0388 data at
  the end of the early data. And if the receiver does ensure that the
  existence of such additional data is causing an ISR failure.)</p>
