.# Abstract

This document specifies the family of Hashed Token SASL mechanisms, which are meant to be used for quick re-authentication of a previous session.
The SASL mechanism's authentication sequence is only one round-trip, which is achieved by the usage of short-lived, exclusively ephemeral hashed tokens.
It further provides hash agility, mutual authentication and is secured by channel binding.

#  Introduction

This specification describes the the family of Hashed Token (HT) Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) [@!RFC4422] mechanisms.
The HT mechanism is designed to be used with short-lived, exclusively ephemeral tokens, called SASL-HT tokens, and allow for quick, one round-trip, re-authentication of a previous session.

Further properties of the HT mechanism are 1) hash agility, 2) mutual authentication, and 3) being secured by channel binding.

Clients are supposed to request SASL-HT tokens from the server after being authenticated using a "strong" SASL mechanism like SCRAM [@RFC5802].
Hence a typical sequence of actions using HT may look like the following:

F> ~~~
F> A) Client authenticates using a strong mechanism (e.g., SCRAM)
F> B) Client requests secret SASL-HT token
F> C) Service returns SASL-HT token
F>    <normal client-server interaction here>
F> D) Connection between client and server gets interrupted,
F>    for example because of a WiFi â†” GSM switch
F> E) Client resumes previous session using HT and token from C)
F> F) Service revokes the sucessfully used SASL-HT token
F>    [goto B]
F> ~~~

The HT mechanism requires an accompanying, application protocol specific, extension, which allows clients to requests a new SASL-HT token.
One example for such an application protocol specific extension based on HT is [@XEP-ISR-SASL2].
This XMPP [@RFC6120] extension protocol allows, amoungst other things, B) and C),

Since the SASL-HT token is not salted, and only one hash iteration is used, the HT mechanism is not suitable to protect long-lived shared secrets (e.g. "passwords").
You may want to look at [@RFC5802] for that.

##  Conventions and Terminology

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**",
"**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [@!RFC2119].

## Applicability

Because this mechanism transports information that should not be controlled by an attacker, the HT mechanism **MUST** only be used over channels protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS, see [@!RFC5246]), or over similar integrity-protected and authenticated channels.
Also the application protoocl specific extension which requests a new SASL-HT token **SHOULD** only be used over similar protected channels.

In addition, when TLS is used, the client MUST successfully validate the server's certificate ([@!RFC5280], [@!RFC6125]).

The family of HT mechanisms is not applicable for proxy authentication, since they can not carry a authorization identity string (authzid).

#  The HT Family of Mechanisms

Each mechanism in this family differs by the choice of the hash algorithm and the choice of the channel binding [@!RFC5929] type.

A HT mechanism name is a string beginning with "HT-" followed by the capitalized name of the used hash, followed by "-", and suffixed by one of 'ENDP' and 'UNIQ'.

Hence each HT mechanism has a name of the following form:

F> ~~~
F> HT-<hash-alg>-<cb-type>
F> ~~~

Where \<hash-alg\> is the capitalized "Hash Name String" of the IANA "Named Information Hash Algorithm Registry" [@!iana-hash-alg] as specified in [@!RFC6920], and \<cb-type\> is one of 'ENDP' or 'UNIQ' denoting the channel binding type.
In case of 'ENDP', the tls-server-end-point channel binding type is used.
In case of 'UNIQ', the tls-unique channel binding type is used.
Valid channel binding types are defined in the IANA "Channel-Binding Types" registry [@!iana-cbt] as specified in [@!RFC5056].

CBT   | Channel Binding Type
------|-----------------------
ENDP  | tls-server-end-point
UNIQ  | tls-unique
Table: Mapping of CBT to Channel Bindings

The following table lists the HT SASL mechanisms registered by this document.

Mechanism Name      | HT Hash Algorithm   | Channel-binding unique prefix
--------------------|---------------------|------------------------------
HT-SHA-512-ENDP     | SHA-512             | tls-server-end-point
HT-SHA-512-UNIQ     | SHA-512             | tls-unique
HT-SHA3-512-ENDP    | SHA3-512            | tls-server-end-point
HT-SHA-256-UNIQ     | SHA-256             | tls-unique

# The HT Authentication Exchange

The mechanism consists of a simple exchange of exactly two messages between the initiator and responder.

The following syntax specifications use the Augmented Backus-Naur form (ABNF) notation as specified in [@!RFC5234].

## Initiator First Message

The HT mechanism starts with the initiator-msg, send by the initiator to the responder.
The follwing lists the ABNF syntax for the initiator-msg:

initiator-msg = authcid-length authcid-data initiator-hashed-token

authcid-length = 2OCTET

authcid-data = 1*OCTET

initiator-hashed-token = 1*OCTET

The initiator-msg starts with an unsigned 16-bit integer in big endian.
It denotes length of the authcid-data, which contains the authentication identity.
Before sending the authentication identity string the initiator **SHOULD** prepare the data with the UsernameCasePreserved profile of [@!RFC8265].

The authcid-data is followed by initiator-hashed-token.
The value of the initiator-hashed-token is defined as follows:

initiator-hashed-token := HMAC(token, "Initiator" || cb-data)

HMAC() is the function defined in [@!RFC2104] with H being the selected HT hash algorithm, 'cb-data' represents the data provided by the selected channel binding type, and 'token' are the UTF-8 encoded octets of the SASL-HT token string which acts as shared secret between initiator and responder.

The initiator-msg **MAY** be included in TLS 1.3 0-RTT early data, as specified in [@!I-D.ietf-tls-tls13#21].
If this is the case, then the initiating entity **MUST NOT** include any further appliction protocol payload in the early data besides the HT initiator-msg and potential required framing of the SASL profile.
The responder **MUST** abort the SASL authentication if the early data contains additional application protocol payload.

> TODO: It should be possible to exploit TLS 1.3 early data for "0.5"
> RTT resumption of the application protocol's session. That is, on
> resumption the initiating entity MUST NOT send any application
> protocol payload together with first flight data, besides the HT
> initiator-msg. But if the responding entity is able to verify the
> TLS 1.3 early data, then it can send additional application protocol
> payload right away together with the "resumption successful"
> response to the initiating entity.

> TODO: Add note why HMAC() is always involved, even if HMAC() is
> usually not required when modern hash algorithms are used.

## Initiator Authentication

Upon receiving the initiator-msg, the responder calculates itself the value of initiator-hashed-token and compares it with the received value found in the initiator-msg.
If both values are equal, then the initiator has been successfully authenticated.
Otherwise, if both values are not equal, then authentication **MUST** fail.

If the responder was able to authenticate the initiator, then the used token **MUST** be revoked immediately. 

## Final Responder Message

After the initiator was authenticated the responder continues the SASL authentication by sending the responder-msg to the initiator.

The ABNF for responder-msg is:

responder-msg = 1*OCTET

The responder-msg value is defined as follows:

responder-msg := HMAC(token, "Responder" || cb-data)

The initiating entity **MUST** verify the responder-msg to achieve mutual authentication.

# Compliance with SASL Mechanism Requirements

This section describes compliance with SASL mechanism requirements specified in Section 5 of [@!RFC4422].

1.   "HT-SHA-256-ENDP", "HT-SHA-256-UNIQ", "HT-SHA-3-512-ENDP" and "HT-SHA-3-512-UNIQ".
2.   Definition of server-challenges and client-responses:
     a)  HT is a client-first mechanism.
     b)  HT does send additional data with success (the responder-msg).
3.   HT is not capable of transferring authorization identities from the client to the server.
4.   HT does not offer any security layers (HT offers channel binding instead).
5.   HT does not protect the authorization identity.

#  Security Considerations

To be secure, the HT mechanism **MUST** be used over a TLS channel that has had the session hash extension [@!RFC7627] negotiated, or session resumption **MUST NOT** have been used.

It is RECOMMENDED that implementations peridically require a full authentication using a strong SASL mechanism which does not use the SASL-HT token.

#  IANA Considerations

IANA has added the following family of SASL mechanisms to the SASL Mechanism registry established by [@!RFC4422]:
