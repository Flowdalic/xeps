<section1 topic='Introduction' anchor='intro'>

  <p>SASL channel-binding is a technique to increase the security of
  connections (&rfc5056;). Unfortunately, the SASL profile specified
  in &rfc6120; lacks a method for the server to announce its supported
  channel-binding types. This hinders the adoption of channel-binding,
  especially since the error protocol to execute after a client
  requested a channel-binding type unsupported by the server is
  basically unspecified.</p>

  <p>The extension defined herein fills the gap left by &rfc6120;, by
  allowing the server the announce its supported channel-binding
  types.</p>

</section1>

<section1 topic='Announcing the SASL Channel-Binding Type Capability' anchor='sasl-cb-type'>

  <p>This protocol consists of a single optional extension element
  named 'sasl-channel-binding' qualified by the 'urn:xmpp:sasl-cb:0'
  namespace. The 'sasl-channel-binding' element MUST contain one or
  more 'channel-binding' elements, of which each MUST have an
  attribute with the name 'type'. The value of the 'type' attribute
  SHOULD be the "Channel-binding unique prefix" of a channel-binding
  type which was registered with the &iana-cb-types;.</p>

  <p>A server declares that it supports particular channel-binding
  types by listing the supported types via the 'sasl-channel-binding'
  element defined herein. The 'sasl-channel-binding' element could
  appear as child element to the SASL &lt;mechanisms/&gt;
  stream-feature element, qualified by the
  'urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl' namespace, as specified in
  &rfc6120;. Another potential appearance of
  &lt;sasl-channel-binding&gt; is as child element of the
  &lt;mechanisms/&gt; stream-feature element as specified in the
  &xep0388;.</p>
